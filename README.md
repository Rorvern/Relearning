# Relearning
I am actually using this as a way to relearn everything I forgot after taking a coding break, as well as to learn new things. What it is is a bunch of games that fall under the category of Paper and Pencil Games. The games I have chosen are: Hangman, Rock Paper Scissors, Mastermind, Dots and Boxes, Tic Tac Toe, Connect Four, and Hexagon. 
## The Games
#### The following games are single player, but they each have a two player mode.
### Hangman
##### Single Player
This is what you would normally expect from a hangman: the computer will generate a word and give you the number of spaces. There will be a space to guess a letter, and you have 6 wrong guesses. When you guess, the letter will either be placed in the word where it is and an X will appear on it in the letter box, or your hangman will get a limb while the letter gets an X in the letter box and the letter will be displayed in the incorrect section. When you get the word right or lose, the hangman's face will change and a message saying 'You got it! :D' or 'You died. D:' will be shown.
##### Two Player
Like the rest of the games with both modes available, there will be a button next to the 'Back to selection' button saying 'Switch mode'. The way this mode works is simply that there will be a line for one person to put a word, then when they press the 'Submit' button, the correct amount of letters will be shown below the hangman's podium, and the guessing will begin as above.
### Rock Paper Scissors
##### Single Player
RPS is probably the simplest of all: You are given the options of Rock, Paper, and Scissors, and when you choose one the computer will too. The results will be displayed.
##### Two Player
The main difference between one and two player is that two player has which player's turn it is above the selection. Whenever it goes back to player one's turn, it will display the results.
### Mastermind
##### Single Player
This game is similar in more than a few ways to Hangman. A random color combination will be chosen, and it will be displayed on the side but covered by a box. You will have twelve guesses. After each guess, the computer will say a random combination of 'Correct' and 'Incorrect', but the order will not be based on the guess. The guess is chosen by clicking on one of the four squares. When this is done, it will change color. 
##### Two Player
The way this mode works is simply that there will be a section on the side, which is normally the square where the computer puts it's generated combination, and then once the player clicks submit, it will be covered by a square.
#### The following games are only two player. If you have any suggestions on how to make them single player as well, they would be appreciated.
### Dots and Boxes
This game is made of a grid of dots. The player clicks the space between two of the dots, making a line. The space where the line will be made before the clicked will be outlined with the color that the line is going to be. The goal is to make a square of one color, and the player who does that first will win. It will also say at the top of the grid whose turn it is. The colors are red and blue.
### Tic Tac Toe
This is going to be the generic Tic Tac Toe: there are nine spaces in a 3x3 grid to choose from, the first person to make three in a row wins. Before the player clicks to choose where they go, the shape that they are will appear in that space, but faded. The shapes are X and O.
### Connect Four
This is similar to tic tac toe, but with a 7x7 grid. Also, you have to start from the bottom and build up; you can't just do any space on the board. Also, in this you have to get four in a row instead. Similar to the Tic Tac Toe, when you hover over a column it will show where you will be on that column and which color it will be. The colors are red and green.
### Hexagon
The way this game works is that there are six dots in the shape of a hexagon, and plauers take turns connecting dots. The first person to make a triangle with their lines loses. Similarly to Dots and Boxes, where you are going will be outlined. The colors are also red and blue, and like always, it will show whose turn it is above the board.
